# Photo-gallery Project üñºÔ∏è

## Purpose and Motive üí°
Coming from a family deeply rooted in photography, I've nurtured a genuine passion for the art of creating captivating images that resonate with powerful emotions. Documenting my journey, I've curated a portfolio that displays my growth and evolving artistic vision. üì∏‚ú®

I embarked on this project to showcase my evolving photography journey through a technical lens. By combining my passion for imagery with web development skills, I've created a portfolio that highlights my progress in photography and demonstrates my proficiency in ReactJS and self-taught vanilla CSS. ‚úèÔ∏è

This responsive front-end web application with React and CSS focuses on user experience. I wanted to incorporate technologies that made the user interface accessible and interactive. With this in mind, I created an interface that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring that users can access and interact with the application regardless of their chosen device. Furthermore, for the navigation of the web application, I integrated client-side routing via React Router in a React project, enabling seamless transitions between pages within the application. To enhance user experience, I engineered a dynamic and interactive circular array of sorted images on the landing page using React states.
