# Photo-gallery Project üñºÔ∏è

A website that displays my life journey through photography. My purpose for this website was for me to see my progress in shooting and display it to my friends and family. A key theme I kept in mind when developing this project was white space. White space allows the colors and composition of photos to jump out at you! Thanks for taking a look :)

## Purpose and Motive üí°
Coming from a family deeply rooted in photography, I've nurtured a genuine passion for the art of creating captivating images that resonate with powerful emotions. Documenting my journey, I've curated a portfolio that displays my growth and evolving artistic vision. üì∏‚ú®
