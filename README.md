# Photo-gallery Project 🖼️

## Purpose and Motive 💡
Coming from a family deeply rooted in photography, I've nurtured a genuine passion for the art of creating captivating images that resonate with powerful emotions. Documenting my journey, I've curated a portfolio that displays my growth and evolving artistic vision. 📸✨

I embarked on this project to showcase my evolving photography journey through a technical lens. By combining my passion for imagery with web development skills, I've created a portfolio that highlights my progress in photography and demonstrates my proficiency in ReactJS and self-taught vanilla CSS. ✏️
